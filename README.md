- export (multiple export), export default (only one default export per file)

- class overload constructor (difference from java, weird, not recommend to use)

- override function (same to java)

- static, global properties (static is class-type variable, while others is object-type variable)

- abstract class (can not create instance from abs class)

- extend, super (think it simple, extend in TypeScript is just focus on the child class)

- interface (error when conflict with union properties), type (more open in union properties)

- readonly (only changes in constructor)

- namespace

- generic class
